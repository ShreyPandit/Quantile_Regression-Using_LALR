# Quantile-Regression_Lipschitz
Implemented the Paper - LALR: Theoretical and Experimental validation of Lipschitz Adaptive Learning Rate in Regression and Neural Networks<br>
The purpose was using Quantile Regression with check loss under the influence of Lipschitz Adaptive Learning Rate <br>
# Dataset <br>
There were 3 dataset used <br>
1) California Housing Dataset <br>
2) Boston Housing Dataset <br>
3) Energy Efficiency Dataset <br>
# Result <br>
The result showed the performance was better while using LALR as the learning Rate in all 3 dataset as compared to constant LR <br>
